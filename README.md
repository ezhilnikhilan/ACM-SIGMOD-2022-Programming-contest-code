# ACM-SIGMOD-2022-Programming-contest
This repository contains our code for ACM SIGMOD Programming Contest. We were selected as one of the top 5 teams in this competition.

### STEPS TO RUN THE CODE (Requires PYTHON 3.9):
  
  1. Install dependencies from "requirements.txt" using "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
  2. Run the "execute.py" file using "python3.9 execute.py". This will generate the output.csv file within the same directory.
